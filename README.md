**Machine Learning Project**

Cricket Player Performance Analysis and Recommendation System 


## Overview
This project is designed to analyze the performance of cricket players based on various statistics and provide recommendations for player selection using machine learning techniques. By processing historical data of cricket matches, including player statistics, opposition teams, and match outcomes, the system derives insights and makes informed recommendations.

**Features**
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, converts data types, and prepares the dataset for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understands the distribution of various features, relationships between variables, and summary statistics of player performance.

**Machine Learning Model Training:** Trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model using historical player performance data to predict player performance against specific opposition teams.

**Recommendation System:** Provides recommendations for player selection based on the trained model. Users input a player's name and opposition team, and the system suggests a player with a similar performance                               history against that team.

**Interactive User Interface:** Features an interactive user interface using IPython widgets for seamless user interaction. Users input player names and opposition teams to receive recommendations.

## Usage
**Data Preparation:** Ensure the availability of historical cricket match data in CSV format, including player statistics, opposition teams, and relevant features.

**Environment Setup:** Set up a Python environment with dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Run scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare the dataset for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the dataset using provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts. Visualize feature distribution, variable relationships, and summary statistics.

**Model Training:** Train the KNN classification model using historical player performance data. Tune hyperparameters if necessary for better performance.

**User Interface:** Launch the interactive user interface to receive player recommendations. Utilize provided IPython widgets to input player names and opposition teams, and view recommendations.
